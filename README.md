Computer code: Estimating heritability

This coding was written by Milan Lstibůrek, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, to calculate the narrow-sense heritability using a novel approach presented in:

Lstibůrek M., Bittner V., Hodge G.H., Picek J. and Mackay T.F.C. (201.). Estimating realized heritability in panmictic populations. XXXXX.

The project consists of 3 routines in R language, it was developed and tested under the R version 3.3.3. Comments are provided within each routine.
