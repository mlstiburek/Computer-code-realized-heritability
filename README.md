# Computer code: Estimating realized heritability
This coding was written by Milan Lstibůrek, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, to calculate the narrow-sense heritability using a novel approach presented in:

Lstibůrek M., Bittner V., Hodge G.R., Picek J., & Mackay T.F.C. (2018). Estimating Realized Heritability in Panmictic Populations. Genetics 208(1): 89-95.

The project consists of 3 routines in R language, it was developed and tested under the R version 3.3.3. Comments are provided within each routine.
